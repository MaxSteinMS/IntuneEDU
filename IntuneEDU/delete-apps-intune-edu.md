# Delete apps from Intune for Education 
Delete an app from your Intune tenant. Deleted apps are removed from group assignments *and* uninstalled from devices.  

To assign the app again, you will need to add it back to your Intune tenant through the App Store.  

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Office desktop apps, Microsoft Store for Education apps, and VPP token apps cannot be deleted. To remove these from a device or user, change its group assignment.

1. From the Intune for Education dashboard, click **Apps**.
2. Go to the app list and select to view apps for iOS or Windows.
3. Click the app that you want to delete.
4. Click **Delete App**.
5. Click **Delete** to confirm your action.
