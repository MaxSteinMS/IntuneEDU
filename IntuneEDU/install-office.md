# Add Microsoft Office to Windows 10 devices

Assign the Microsoft Office [web app](add-web-apps-edu.md) or [desktop app](add-desktop-apps-edu.md) to Windows 10 devices in Intune for Education.    
## Select during Express Configuration
During [Express Configuration](Express-configuration-intune-edu.md), all Office desktop apps are available in a single app called "Office 365." Select it to assign students desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Skype for Business.  

## Office for Windows 10 S

Students on Windows 10 S devices, such as the [Surface Laptop](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/devices/surface-laptop/overview), receive the Universal versions of the Office apps. These versions differ from Office apps for Windows 10, and are available for purchase from the Microsoft Store for Education.
