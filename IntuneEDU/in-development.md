* By default, local Autopilot Reset will be disabled.  
 
## Manage Windows Autopilot
From the Intune for Education portal, you'll be able to:

* Configure Autopilot deployment profiles.
* Create dynamic groups for Autopilot-registered devices based on group tags. 
* Monitor and review device deployments.
