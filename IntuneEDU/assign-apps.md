# Installing apps on school devices

To install an app on a school device, you have to first assign it to a group. This article describes three ways to assign apps to student teachers.  

After you assign an app, the app is sent to the appropriate device. App installation is initiated when the device checks in to Intune for Education. 

## Add apps to Intune for Education inventory
By default, popular apps are available in Intune for Education for immediate assignment. If the app you want to assign isn't in your inventory, learn how to add it to Intune for Education with one of the following articles:
* [Microsoft Store for Education apps](acquire-store-apps.md)
* [Free iOS App Store apps](add-apps-ios.md)
* [iOS VPP apps](add-vpp-apps-ios.md)
* [Windows 10 desktop apps](add-desktop-apps-edu.md)
* [Web apps](add-web-apps-edu.md)  

## Assign apps with Express Configuration
Go to [express configuration](Express-configuration-intune-edu.md) to assign multiple apps to a single group. 

1. From the Intune for Education dashboard, click **Express Configuration**.  
2. Choose the group you want to add apps to. Then click **Next**.
3. Choose one or more apps to deploy to your group. Then click **Next**. 
4. The apps will automatically be assigned to your group. Continue through express configuration.

4. Choose one or more apps to deploy to your group. 
5. Choose **Save** to deploy the selected apps to that group. Installation will automatically begin the next time the device checks-in to Intune for Education.
