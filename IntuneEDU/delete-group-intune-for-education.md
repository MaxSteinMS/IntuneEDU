# Delete a group  

When you delete a *device* group, apps and settings are removed from the devices that belonged to the group. The devices themselves are not deleted. When you delete a *user* group, user members can no longer access assigned apps. The users themselves are not deleted.

Deleting a group does not remove users or devices from Intune management.

  ![Delete groups buttons encircled in red](./media/groups-011-delete-groups.png)

1. Select the group you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete group**. 
3. Click **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the group.
