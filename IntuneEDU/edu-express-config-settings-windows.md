# Default Windows 10 configurations in Express Configuration
Express Configuration shows the most common Windows settings to help you quickly set up your Windows devices. This article lists each of those settings and describes what they do.

Make changes to fit your school's rules and policies, or click straight through the settings page to apply the preset recommendations.

For the complete list of settings and descriptions, see [All Windows 10 settings in Intune for Education](all-edu-settings-windows.md). 

## Accounts and sign-in 

|Setting|What it does|  
|---|---|
|Block adding and signing in with personal Microsoft accounts |Block students and teachers from adding and signing in to personal Microsoft accounts on the device. Personal Microsoft accounts refer to accounts that use a Microsoft domain name, but aren't in your school's Azure Active Directory tenant.|  
|Block adding and signing in with non-Microsoft accounts|Block students and teachers from adding and signing in to non-Microsoft accounts, such as Google, Yahoo, and iCloud. Use this setting to force users to only use their Microsoft accounts for email.|
|Configure preferred Azure Active Directory tenant domain|Configure your school's domain name so that users can sign in to Windows without it. For example, instead of signing in with the username *alain\@contoso.com*, a student would only need to sign in with *alain*. When configured, this setting prepopulates your tenant domain name, but you can still edit it.|
