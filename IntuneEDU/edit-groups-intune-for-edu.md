# Edit existing groups

This article describes how to change the following group attributes from the Intune for Education portal > **Groups** page:

* Group name
* Group membership
* List location
* Group rules 

## Edit group name   
Change the name of an existing group.
1. Click the group you want to edit in your **Groups list**.
2. Click **Rename**.
3. Enter a new name in **Group name**.
4. Click **OK**.

## Manually assign members to groups 
Follow this procedure to add or remove users and devices to an existing assigned group.

If you add or remove a member of a group, the member, whether it is a device or user, may experience a change in access or permissions.

The instructions below detail how to edit *user* membership. These steps can also be followed to edit membership for device groups.

1. Go to **Groups** and select the group you want to assign users to. 
2. Click **Edit user membership**.
3. To assign users:  
    a. Select one or more members of **All other users**.  
    b. Click **Add users**.  
4. To unassign users:    
    a. Select one or more members of **Users in group**.  
    b. Click **Remove users**.
5. Click **OK**.

## Edit dynamic group rules  
Adjust dynamic group rules to accommodate new devices, locations, or school years.

Editing existing rules may remove devices or users who were previously members of the group. Edits may cause them to experience a change in permissions or access. 

1. Go to **Groups** and select the group you want to edit.
2. Click **Edit group rules**.
3. Make changes to the rules. 
4. Click **Save changes**.  

## Move a group  

Move a group up or down within your existing group list. If you distribute settings differently throughout your group list, moving a group higher or lower on the list changes its scope of settings.

Generally, the higher the position of the group, such as at parent level, the broader its settings.
